/*
* This cpp source file contains all the functions needed in opencv from beginner to advanced levels. 
* I choosed to write each functionality as a void function in the developement process instead of multiple cpp files to keep the 
* sequential flow of the course and also to avoid ambiguity. Each function can be used independantly by calling it from the main function.
